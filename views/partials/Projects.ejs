                There are multiple kinds of websites that I would be very interested in 
                learn how to develop them, such as the ones that I mention ahead:

                Kahoot it’s a very dynamic platform where multiple users can make quizzes 
                (all connected at the same time) with multiple choices and in a very 
                interactive way. Nowadays these kinds of websites are taking more relevance 
                due to communication and convivence activities are migrating to digital platforms.

                    Social media it’s another growing market niche, plenty of new social networks 
                    are being developed every day and there’s almost for sure that you can find 
                    one for almost every topic that you want. Even so, I consider these kinds of 
                    websites as a must-know for any website developer.

                    For last, eCommerce has shown how relevant can be for the markets nowadays. 
                    All the businesses are getting notice that there is a big part of users that 
                    they need to captive yet, and are those who are buying exclusively through the 
                    digital stores. Develop a major filters system to offer the customers the 
                    greatest buying experience would be something that I would really enjoy.
