                    My name is Ricardo Barona, and I consider myself a technological geek. 
                    I enjoy everything that involves: technology, coding, science, logical 
                    thinking and more. I’ve always been a fanatic of gadgets and engineering 
                    because most of the time it implies a lot of innovation and is fantastic 
                    to realize how human's ingenuity always find a way to solve all kind of 
                    challenges. What I like the most is work developing ideas and projects that 
                    help my clients to improve their business or their lives so do not hesitate to 
                    contact me in case that you want to see come true that idea that you have in mind.
